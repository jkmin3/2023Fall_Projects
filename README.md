# 2023Fall_Projects

## Background
I wanted to dive into a project closely related to climate change because it is becoming a bigger issue in our world and there is also a lot of misinformation about this topic. I can see from the original notebook had a lot of wrong conclusions made from their graphs. Therefore, I went ahead and downloaded the notebook below from Kaggle and improved on it and expanded on it as well. 

## Notebook and Data
This project is an improvement of this notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/booroom/climate-change-effects-in-london-since-1979-eda/notebook).
The Data that was used was data about London's weather from 1979-2020, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data). This was the data used for the original project, but I thought it would be better if we were to compare data from another location. That's when I downloaded data from Chicago which is close to home for me. 

Data from 1979-2020 for Chicago from [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/lcd). 

## Hypotheses

One of my main hypotheses was that temperature and precipitation levels would be rising each year. This is because with climate change, the temperature of the Earth is steadily rising and causing more water to appear due to the melting of ice. I was correct in these hypotheses.

Another hypothesis that I had was that the amount of snow melted would increase every year, it came to my shock that it was actually decreasing. This led me to believe that perhaps there isn't a lot of snow to be melted anymore.
