# 2023Fall_Projects

This project is an improvement of this notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/booroom/climate-change-effects-in-london-since-1979-eda/notebook).

The Data that was used was data about London's weather from 1979-2020, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data).

I also pulled data from 1979-2020 for Chicago from [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/lcd).
